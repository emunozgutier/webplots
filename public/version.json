    "commit_title": "Add histogram support and UI controls",
    "commit_message": "Introduce histogram mode across stores, UI and plot generation.\n\n- AxisSideMenu: add plotType to state, radio buttons to switch between scatter/histogram, and hide the X-axis drop target when histogram is selected. Expose setPlotType and include plotType in loadProject/createAxisSideMenuConfig.\n- PlotLayoutStore: add histogramBins to PlotLayout state with setter.\n- PlotLayout component: add local controls for histogram bins (start, end, size, underflow, overflow) and persist via setHistogramBins when saving layout.\n- PlotlyHelpers.generatePlotConfig: support histogram mode by adjusting hasData checks, creating histogram traces with xbins/autobinx, applying underflow/overflow handling, using value-based x-axis/title text, and emitting appropriate code for histogram traces. Adjust scatter behavior to remain unchanged.\n\nThese changes enable building histograms with configurable binning while preserving existing scatter functionality.",
