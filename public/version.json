    "commit_title": "Add ink physics animation and output GIF",
    "commit_message": "Add a new Matplotlib animation script (scripts/ink_physics_animation.py) that simulates three circles (A, B, C) with easing/repulsion behavior to visualize an \"ink ratio\" physics demo. The script animates positions and opacity, attempts to save an MP4 via ffmpeg and falls back to a GIF (public/ink_ratio_physics.gif) using Pillow; output is placed in the public directory. Requires numpy, matplotlib, and either ffmpeg or Pillow to export the animation.",
