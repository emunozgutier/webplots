Call this script in package.json predeploy so version.json is generated before builds, and include an initial public/version.json sample. Update TopMenuBar.tsx to add a \"Version\" menu item and modal UI that fetches and displays the version, commit title, and commit message (uses import.meta.env.BASE_URL to locate version.json). This enables the app to surface build/commit metadata to users.",
