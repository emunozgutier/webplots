    "commit_message": "Replace redundant percentage ranges in InkRatioAnimation keyframes with explicit 0%/50%/100% stops. Updated shrinkPoint, pulseSize, and pulseGlow animations in src/components/SideMenuComponents/subcomponents/InkRatioAnimation.tsx to use single percentage entries instead of repeating ranges (e.g. 0%,25% -> 0%; 75%,100% -> 100%), keeping the same transform origins and animation behavior while making the CSS clearer and more concise.",
